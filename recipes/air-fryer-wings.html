        <h1>Air Fryer Chicken Wings Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a recipe for air fryer chicken wings. They'll get 
            crispy, almost as crispy as deep fried wings. They'll be way 
            healthier than fried wings as well. Feel free to finish these 
            wings in your hot sauce of choice.
